# Day Count Garmin Widget
Day counting widget for Garmin API 4.1.0+, this was wrote for personal use, so only tested on Epix gen2. This is a widget attempt to do what Days Matter does on iOS. 

## FlowChart


## Functions so far
1. Glance view of an user-selected Event date, with the set date, and days counting up or down.
2. In the widget, there are three slots to store dates, count up or down is decided by the input date.
4. User can set galnce, edit, or delete events.

## Still need to be done
1. When the count down reach 0.
2. Notification system.
3. Complete the info page.
4. refresh after actions in saved events? Depends on the memory usage.
5. Find a way to update teh glance once a day?
